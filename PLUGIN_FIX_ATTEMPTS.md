## Attempt 1: Add `strategy: 'eager'` to MFSU

**Rationale:** The MFSU strategy (`normal` vs `eager`) affects how dependencies are processed. While seemingly unrelated to output generation, it's a simple tweak within the existing `mfsu` block that might influence the overall MF process. The UmiJS docs mention `'eager'` for large codebases or frequently changing dependencies, suggesting it alters build behavior significantly.

**Changes:** Add `strategy: 'eager'` to the `mfsu` block in both plugin `.umirc.ts` files.

**Execution:**
- Modified `.umirc.ts` for both plugins.
- Ran `npm run build` for both plugins.

**Result:** **Failed.** Builds completed successfully, but `remoteEntry.js` was still not generated in `public/client`.

## Attempt 2: Disable MFSU, Use Explicit `mf` Config

**Rationale:** Since configuring MFSU seems problematic or insufficient for generating `remoteEntry.js`, let's disable it entirely (`mfsu: false`) and rely *only* on the standard UmiJS Module Federation configuration block (`mf`). This removes potential conflicts or overrides from MFSU.

**Changes:**
1.  Set `mfsu: false` in both plugin `.umirc.ts` files.
2.  Add an explicit `mf` block with `name`, `filename`, `exposes`, and `shared` in both files.

**Execution:**
- Modified `.umirc.ts` for both plugins.
- Ran `npm run build` for both plugins.

**Result:** **Failed.** Build failed with `AssertionError [ERR_ASSERTION]: Invalid config keys: mf`. The top-level `mf` config key is not supported.

---

## Attempt 3: Use MFSU with Explicit `shared` Config

**Rationale:** Go back to the `mfsu` configuration which allows the build to complete, but this time explicitly define the `shared` dependencies within the `mfsu` block. Perhaps defining what the plugin expects to share/consume influences the generation of the `remoteEntry.js` manifest.

**Changes:**
1. Ensure `mfsu` block is present.
2. Ensure `mfName` and `exposes` are defined within `mfsu`.
3. Add a `shared` block within `mfsu` defining `react`, `react-dom`, `antd`.

**Execution:**
- Modified `.umirc.ts` for both plugins.
- Ran `npm run build` for both plugins.

**Result:** **Failed.** Builds completed successfully, but `remoteEntry.js` was still not generated in `public/client`.

---

## Attempt 4: Use MFSU (mfName, exposes, shared), Remove Explicit AntD Plugin

**Rationale:** The only configuration that allows the build to complete is using `mfsu` with `mfName`, `exposes`, and `shared`, combined with explicitly requiring the AntD plugin. However, this still doesn't generate `remoteEntry.js`. Let's test if removing the explicit AntD plugin `require` might allow MFSU to generate the MF artifacts, even if it potentially reintroduces the `Invalid config keys: antd` error.

**Changes:**
1. Ensure `mfsu` block is present with `mfName`, `exposes`, and `shared`.
2. Remove `require.resolve('@umijs/plugins/dist/antd')` from the `plugins` array.

**Execution:**
- Modified `.umirc.ts` for both plugins.
- Ran `npm run build` for both plugins.

**Result:** **Failed.** Build failed immediately with `AssertionError [ERR_ASSERTION]: Invalid config keys: antd`. Removing the explicit AntD plugin require prevents the build from running.
