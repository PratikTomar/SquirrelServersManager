# Automations

## üå∞ In a Nutshell

:::info ‚ÑπÔ∏è Sum-up
Automations allow you to schedule playbook or Docker action **executions** based on cron scheduled.
:::

## Principles
Automations are formed by two elements:
- A `trigger` (currently only cron-based)
- An `action`

### [Trigger]
The trigger is the "**when**" your automations will launch, and how often.
The only trigger available at this time is "Cron", a time-based trigger that will periodically start according to your settings.

### [Action]
The action is the "**what**" your automations will do.
Two actions are currently available:

|          Action          | Description                                                       |
|:------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------|
|       **Playbook**       | Execute any playbooks registered in SSM                           |
|    **Docker Action**     | Run a Docker action such as `restart` for a specific container    |
| **Docker Volume Action** | Run a Docker Volume action such as `backup` for a specific volume |
